    "## Predictors of birth weight\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we use data on births in the United States to identify and understand predictors of birth weight.  Low birth weight is associated with several immediate risks for the newborn including infection and mortality, as well as longer-term risks for developmental delays and chronic health conditions in adulthood. Low birth weight is usually defined as the birth weight being less than 2500 grams, but this threshold does not play a role in the analyses below.  Instead, we will use quantitative birth weight as an outcome, and consider predictors of birth weight on this quantitative scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used here are a complete record (a census) of all live births in the United States in specific years (for example, in 1971 there are around 1.8 million births). The raw data and documentation are available from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm), or directly from [this page](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/DVS/natality).  You should use the [prep.py](https://github.com/kshedden/case_studies/birthweight/prep.py) script to download the data and generate the CSV files that are used in the analyses below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will present the data, and fit some initial models to explain how birth weight varies with respect to several factors.  A proper analysis of the data should be driven by a scientific aim or hypothesis.  This notebook only provides the scaffolding for such an analysis.  It is up to you to build on this scaffold to produce a coherent analytic narrative."
