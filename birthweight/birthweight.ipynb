    "# Predictors of birth weight\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we use data on births in the United States to identify and understand predictors of birth weight.  Low birth weight is associated with several immediate risks for the newborn including infection and mortality, as well as longer-term risks for developmental delays and chronic health conditions in adulthood. Low birth weight is usually defined as the birth weight being less than 2500 grams, but this threshold does not play a role in the analyses below.  Instead, we will use quantitative birth weight as an outcome, and consider predictors of birth weight on this quantitative scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used here are a complete record (a census) of all live births in the United States in specific years.  The sample sizes are large, for example in 1971 there were around 1.8 million births. The raw data and documentation are available from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm), or directly from [this page](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/DVS/natality).  You should use the [prep.py](https://github.com/kshedden/case_studies/birthweight/prep.py) script to download the data and generate the CSV files that are used in the analyses below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will present the data, and fit some initial models to explain how birth weight varies with respect to several factors.  A proper analysis of the data should be driven by a scientific aim or hypothesis.  This notebook only provides the scaffolding for such an analysis.  It is up to you to build on this scaffold to produce a coherent analytic narrative."

    "To obtain a more precise result targetting a specific research question, we can devise a contrast that most perfectly reflects the scientific research aim.  For example, we may want to focus on the difference between the mother being 35 versus 30 years of age, for a first born child.  Since most births are single births, we can set plurality=1.  One way to proceed would be to take the conditional mean birth weight to a 35 year old mother minus the conditional mean birth weight to a 30 year old mother, setting the father's age to the mean age of all fathers.  This might be interpreted as the purely \"biological\" effect of maternal age.  However, as seen above, mother's age and father's age are correlated.  For many purposes, a more natural approach would be to hold the father's age fixed at the average father age for the given mother age.  To do that, we can fit an auxiliary model for father age in relation to mother age. "
