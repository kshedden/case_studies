# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)

NHANES is a survey of the US population that aims to capture
many aspects of health.  The survey has been repeated every two years since
1999 (and less frequently before that).  Each wave surveys an independent
sample of people, so this is a cross-sectional rather than a longitudinal
study.  The sample is intended to represent the US population, but in
practice the actual sample is not perfectly representative, and weights can be used
if representativeness is very important.

The data are split into different files that can be merged as appropriate.  We will
be using three of the data files, which can be downloaded using one of the 'get_data.X'
scripts.

We will be working with the data from the 2017 NHANES wave, which are
available from the link below.  This link also contains data documentation
that can be used to understand the meanings of the variable names, and the
way that each variable is coded.
